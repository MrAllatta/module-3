I think a pull request is a request to merge a commit from one branch into another. A branch is a pointer to a commit that tracks HEAD. A remote tracking branch is a branch on GitHub that is set to be a remote locally. A remote is any location other than the location of the local repository, so it could be found on a server, like at GitHub or it could be another folder on your machine.

This is a new sentence.
